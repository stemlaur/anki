# Application

This layer demonstrate how simple it is to adapt the model through changes.

The repositories, the event store, and the domain probe are implemented here either using
an in-memory or fake implementations.

We will iterate through the project by adding new modules as soon a decision is ready to be taken,
for now the majority of the effort has been concentrated in the business rules of the domain.

For now the module contains a silly stupid demo in the form of a CLI.
